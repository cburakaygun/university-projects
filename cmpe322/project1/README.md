Download directory `code`.

Open a `Terminal` in directory `code` and run the command `make`.

An executable called  `rrs`  (Round Robin Scheduler) will be created. 

Then, run command `./rrs` on the `Terminal` (in directory `code`).

**NOTES:**
* `rrs` expects the input files (_definition.txt_, _1.code.txt_, _2.code.txt_, etc.) to be in the same directory.
* `rrs` creates an output file named _output.txt_ in the same directory.
