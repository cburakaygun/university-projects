# My University Projects

Stuff I implemented as homeworks/projects during my education at [Boğaziçi University](http://boun.edu.tr).

### [CMPE150 - Introduction to Computing | FALL 2015](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/courses/cmpe150/2015/fall.0)

* #### [Project#1](/cmpe150/project1) `Java`
  The project consists of 2 independent parts. In the first part, it prints an n*n multiplication table with upper triangular elements missing.
  In the second part, it prints a sequence with four integers. Each element in the sequence is equal to  `4 * <numberOfDigitsInPreviousElement>`.

* #### [Project#2](/cmpe150/project2) `Java`
  A simple board game. There is a board with 16 cells (4*4). Each cell contains a letter or `*`. (There are 15 letters and a `*`). Player moves `*` to the horizontally or vertically adjacent cells and collects points.

* #### [Project#3](/cmpe150/project3) `Java`
  There is a board with 256 cells (16*16). Each cell has a color. The purpose is to traverse all the cells and change their colors according to some rules until no change is possible anymore.


### [CMPE160 - Introduction to Object Oriented Programming | SPRING 2016](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/courses/cmpe160/2016/spring)

* #### [Project#1](/cmpe160/project1) `Java`
  Sprinter Turtle - A graphical game in which the player controls a turtle by using arrow keys on the keyboard. The aim of the user is to get the turtle across the street over and over again and during that time to prevent the turtle from getting hit by a car.

* #### [Project#2](/cmpe160/project2) `Java`
  A program that can be used to simualate transportations done by freight trains.
  `Doubly Linked List`, `Priority Queue` and `Stack` implementation.

* #### [Project#3](/cmpe160/project3) `Java`
  Implementation of an `AVL Tree`


### [CMPE230 - Systems Programming | SPRING 2017](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/courses/cmpe230/2017/spring)

* #### [Project#1](/cmpe230/project1) `C++`
  A translator which transforms a file containing assignment statements and expressions (one on each line) to [LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine)](http://llvm.org) code.

* #### [Project#2](/cmpe230/project2) `Python`
  A program which finds duplicate files and/or directories in given directories recursively. It can list paths of those files/directories and execute given commands on them.

* #### [Project#3](/cmpe230/project3) `C++ & QT`
  A graphical hexadecimal calculator which only supports **addition** and **subtraction**.

  I developed this project with [Yaşar Alim Türkmen](https://github.com/alimturkmen).


### [CMPE240 - Digital Systems | SPRING 2017](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/courses/cmpe240/2017/spring)

These are the preliminary works of **CMPE240**, which were studied/implemented before actual laboratory hours.
